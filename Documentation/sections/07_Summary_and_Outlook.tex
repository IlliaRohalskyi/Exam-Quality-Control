\section{Summary and Outlook}

The technical results of the project are significant, as the team successfully implemented the core functionality of the application. The application provides a scoring system for evaluating exam plans based on predefined criteria, generating reports, visualizations, and identifying conflicts. The implemented solution demonstrates a good understanding of the problem domain and effectively addresses the primary objectives.

For the future development, one could refer to part 5.4, where it is broken down in details. But in nutshell: UI, better installability, more rules
Throughout the project process, regular meetings were conducted with the project supervisor and team members to discuss progress, resolve challenges, and align goals. The Agile and Scrum principles guided the iterative development, allowing for flexibility and adapting to changing requirements as needed.
